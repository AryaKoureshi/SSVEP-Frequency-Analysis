# SSVEP-Frequency-Analysis
This repository contains code for analyzing Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) signals recorded from EEG data. The goal of this analysis is to determine the stimulation frequency from the EEG signals recorded in each test. Two methods are employed: Frequency Content Plotting and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA).
